# TODO: P2 - Add Comprehensive Logging for WLED Control Debugging

## Problem Statement

The WLED integration lacks sufficient logging to effectively debug device control issues. When on/off commands fail, there are minimal logs showing what actually happened during the HTTP request/response cycle, making troubleshooting nearly impossible for both users and developers.

**Issue:** Silent failures with no actionable debugging information when device controls don't work.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Current Logging Deficiencies:**
1. **No HTTP Request Details:** Doesn't log actual request URLs, headers, or payloads
2. **Missing Response Information:** No logging of response bodies, status codes beyond errors
3. **No Network-Level Debugging:** Doesn't show connection attempts or timeouts
4. **Insufficient Error Context:** Error logs don't include request details for troubleshooting
5. **No Success Verification:** Doesn't log when commands are confirmed successful

**Debugging Gap Scenario:**
1. User reports on/off control not working
2. Developer checks logs - sees minimal debug information
3. No visibility into actual HTTP requests being sent
4. No visibility into device responses
5. Impossible to determine if issue is network, API, or device-related

## Impact Assessment

**User Experience:**
- Cannot provide useful debugging information when reporting issues
- No visibility into what the integration is actually doing
- Difficult to self-troubleshoot basic connectivity or device issues

**Developer Experience:**
- Impossible to debug issues without user-provided network traces
- Cannot verify integration is making correct API calls
- Hard to distinguish between integration bugs vs device/network issues

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Comprehensive Request/Response Logging (Recommended)
- **Fix:** Add detailed logging for all HTTP requests and responses
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  async def _request(self, method, endpoint, data=None):
      """Make request with comprehensive logging."""
      url = self._build_url(endpoint)

      _LOGGER.debug(
          "WLED API Request: %s %s | Headers: %s | Body: %s",
          method, url, self._get_request_headers(), data
      )

      # ... make request ...

      _LOGGER.debug(
          "WLED API Response: %s | Status: %s | Body: %s",
          url, response.status, await response.text()
      )
  ```

- **Effort:** Medium (1-2 hours)
- **Risk:** Low (can be controlled by log level)

### Option 2: Add Debug Mode Configuration
- **Fix:** Add debug configuration option for verbose logging
- **Implementation:** Integration-wide debug flag for detailed HTTP logging
- **Benefit:** Users can enable detailed logging when troubleshooting
- **Effort:** Small (1 hour)
- **Risk:** Low

### Option 3: Structured Logging Implementation
- **Fix:** Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Implementation:** JSON-structured logs for better parsing and analysis
- **Benefit:** Better log analysis and filtering capabilities
- **Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

**Primary Fix:** Implement comprehensive request/response logging with appropriate log levels to enable effective debugging while avoiding log spam in normal operation.

## Technical Details

**Affected Files:**
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/api.py` - _request and _handle_response methods
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/coordinator.py` - command sending methods
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/light.py` - high-level control methods

**Current Minimal Logging:**
```python
# Current: Only basic debug messages
_LOGGER.debug("Making %s request to %s", method, url)
_LOGGER.debug("Successfully updated state on %s: %s", self.host, state)
```

**Enhanced Logging Implementation:**
```python
async def _request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, data: Optional[Dict] = None):
    """Make request with comprehensive debugging."""
    url = self._build_url(endpoint)

    # Log request details
    _LOGGER.info(
        "WLED Request: %s %s | Host: %s | Payload: %s",
        method, url, self.host, data
    )

    try:
        # ... make request ...

        # Log response details
        response_text = await response.text()
        _LOGGER.info(
            "WLED Response: %s | Status: %s | Response: %s",
            url, response.status, response_text
        )

        return response_data

    except Exception as err:
        _LOGGER.error(
            "WLED Request Failed: %s %s | Error: %s | Payload: %s",
            method, url, err, data
        )
        raise
```

## Log Level Strategy

**INFO Level:**
- All request attempts (method, URL, payload)
- Response status and body for all requests
- Connection success/failure status

**DEBUG Level:**
- HTTP headers (request and response)
- Timing information (request duration)
- Detailed error stack traces

**ERROR Level:**
- Network connection failures
- HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx)
- JSON parsing errors
- Command validation failures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All HTTP requests logged with method, URL, and payload
- [x] All HTTP responses logged with status code and body
- [x] Network connection attempts and failures logged
- [x] Error logs include full request context for troubleshooting
- [x] Success verification logged for device control commands
- [x] Log levels configured appropriately to avoid spam
- [x] Users can enable debug mode for detailed troubleshooting
