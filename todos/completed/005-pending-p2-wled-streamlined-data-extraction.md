# WLED Streamlined Data Extraction

## Problem Statement
The current WLED integration may be attempting to extract and process more data than necessary from WLED device responses, potentially contributing to response handling failures. The user has explicitly stated that only basic parameters are needed: on/off, brightness, preset ID/name, and playlist ID/name.

## Findings
- Current implementation may process entire WLED JSON response
- User requirements are minimal: on/off, brightness, preset info, playlist info
- Complex data extraction may be causing response processing delays or failures
- WLED devices can return large amounts of effect and configuration data
- Processing unnecessary data may increase response handling complexity
- Streamlined approach could improve reliability and performance

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Essential-Only Data Extraction (Preferred)
- Extract only required parameters: state.on, state.bri, preset info, playlist info
- Skip processing of effects, segments, and advanced configuration data
- Implement targeted JSON parsing for specific fields only
- Add fallback handling for missing essential data
- Create simplified data models for essential parameters only

- **Pros**: Faster processing, reduced complexity, more reliable, meets user needs exactly
- **Cons**: Loses advanced features, may require UI changes
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Progressive Data Loading
- Load essential parameters first (on/off, brightness)
- Load preset and playlist data in separate requests if needed
- Implement caching for non-essential data
- Add lazy loading for advanced features
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

- **Pros**: Maintains existing features, improves initial load performance
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, multiple requests to device
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk**: Medium

### Option 3: Selective Response Parsing
- Parse only required sections of JSON response
- Skip large data structures (effects array, segments array)
- Implement JSON path targeting for essential fields
- Add validation for required data presence
- Optimize JSON parsing performance

- **Pros**: Maintains data structure, improves parsing performance
- **Cons**: Still processes full response, complex JSON path implementation
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk**: Medium

## Recommended Action

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**: custom_components/wled_jsonapi/api.py, custom_components/wled_jsonapi/models.py
- **Related Components**: WLEDJSONAPIClient class, data models, response parsing
- **Database Changes**: No
- **Required Data**:
  - state.on (boolean)
  - state.bri (brightness 0-255)
  - preset ID and name
  - playlist ID and name
- **Optional Data**: Effects, segments, advanced configuration (can be skipped)
- **JSON Sources**: /json endpoint (state data), /presets.json endpoint (preset/playlist data)

## Resources
- Original finding: User explicitly stated minimal requirements
- Related issues: 004-pending-p1-wled-response-handling-fix.md (response handling fix)
- Reference: WLED JSON API documentation for data structure
- User Requirements: "only need to extract a few parameters: on/off, brightness, and from presets.json the preset id and preset name as well as playlist id and playlist name"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Only essential parameters extracted from WLED responses
- [ ] Response processing completes faster and more reliably
- [ ] Essential data extraction: on/off, brightness, preset info, playlist info
- [ ] Optional data (effects, segments) skipped or loaded separately
- [ ] Data models simplified for essential parameters only
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained where possible
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable in response processing time
- [ ] Error handling for missing essential data
- [ ] Tests pass for streamlined data extraction

## Work Log

### 2025-10-18 - Initial Discovery
**By:** Claude Triage System
**Actions:**
- Identified that current implementation may be over-processing data
- User explicitly stated minimal requirements for essential parameters only
- Created as P2 important (improves performance and reliability)
- Estimated effort: Small (1-2 hours)
- Dependency on primary response handling fix

**Learnings:**
- User requirements are simple and focused on core functionality
- Over-processing data may be contributing to response handling failures
- Streamlined approach could both fix issues and improve performance
- Essential-only extraction matches user needs exactly
- Simpler data models are more reliable and easier to maintain

## Notes
Source: Triage session on 2025-10-18
Priority: Important - improves performance and reliability significantly
Dependency: Should be implemented after primary response handling fix
Context: User explicitly stated minimal requirements, suggesting over-processing issue
User Insight: "It should be fairly simple since we only need to extract a few parameters"
