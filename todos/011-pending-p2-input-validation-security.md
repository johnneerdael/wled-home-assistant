# Enhance Input Validation to Prevent DNS Rebinding and Malicious Inputs

## Problem Statement
The config flow only performs basic empty validation for host inputs, allowing potentially malicious hostnames that could lead to DNS rebinding attacks, hostname injection, or connections to unintended devices. The current validation is insufficient for security-sensitive IoT integration.

**Security Risk**: MEDIUM - Potential for DNS rebinding and malicious hostname injection
**Impact**: Connection to unintended devices, potential security bypass, network reconnaissance

**Affected Location**: `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/config_flow.py` lines 56-63
```python
host = user_input[CONF_HOST].strip()

# Validate host input
if not host:
    errors["base"] = "invalid_host"
    return self.async_show_form(...)
```

## Findings
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient hostname validation in config flow
- **Attack Vectors**: DNS rebinding, protocol injection, malicious hostname injection
- **Security Gap**: No validation of hostname format, length, or content
- **Network Risk**: Could be exploited to bypass network security measures
- **IoT Context**: Particularly important for devices that may be exposed to less secure networks

**Current Validation Issues**:
1. Only checks for empty string
2. No format validation for IP addresses or hostnames
3. No prevention of protocol injection (`http://`, `https://` in hostname)
4. No length limits or character restrictions
5. No network security validation

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Comprehensive Hostname Validation (Recommended)
- **Fix**: Add robust hostname/IP validation function
- **Implementation**: Format validation, length limits, character restrictions
- **Security Features**: Prevent protocol injection, validate character sets
- **Network Validation**: Check for private vs public network usage

```python
def _validate_host(self, host: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate host input to prevent malicious inputs."""
    host = host.strip()

    # Check for reasonable length
    if len(host) > 253 or len(host) < 1:
        return False, "Invalid hostname length"

    # Prevent protocol injection
    if '://' in host.lower():
        return False, "Protocol not allowed in hostname"

    # Validate IP address format
    try:
        ip = ipaddress.ip_address(host)
        if ip.is_private:
            return True, "Private IP address"
        else:
            return False, "Public IP addresses not recommended for IoT devices"
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Validate hostname format
    if re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$', host):
        # Prevent consecutive dots
        if '..' in host:
            return False, "Invalid hostname format"
        # Prevent starting/ending with dot or hyphen
        if host.startswith(('.', '-')) or host.endswith(('.', '-')):
            return False, "Invalid hostname format"
        return True, "Valid hostname"

    return False, "Invalid hostname format"
```

- **Pros**: Comprehensive security, prevents multiple attack vectors, user-friendly feedback
- **Cons**: Additional complexity in config flow
- **Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Basic Format Validation
- **Fix**: Add basic hostname/IP format validation
- **Implementation**: Simple regex patterns and basic checks
- **Security Features**: Prevent obvious injection attempts
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages

- **Pros**: Simple implementation, good security improvement
- **Cons**: May miss edge cases, less comprehensive
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 3: Network Security Focus
- **Fix**: Focus on network security validation
- **Implementation**: Check for private vs public network usage
- **Security Features**: Warn about public network usage
- **User Guidance**: Provide IoT security recommendations

- **Pros**: Addresses most critical security concerns, educational value
- **Cons**: Doesn't address all input validation issues
- **Effort**: Small (1 hour)
- **Risk**: Low

## Recommended Action
[Leave blank - needs user approval for implementation approach]

## Technical Details
- **Affected Files**:
  - `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/config_flow.py` (input validation)
  - `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/const.py` (validation constants)
- **Related Components**: Config flow validation, error handling
- **Database Changes**: No
- **Dependencies**: May need `ipaddress` and `re` modules
- **Configuration**: Enhanced error messages and validation feedback

## Security Impact Analysis

**Current Vulnerabilities**:
1. **DNS Rebinding**: Malicious DNS responses could redirect to attacker-controlled servers
2. **Protocol Injection**: Could potentially inject `http://` or other protocols
3. **Hostname Injection**: Malicious characters could bypass security controls
4. **Network Reconnaissance**: Could be used to probe network infrastructure

**Proposed Mitigations**:
1. **Format Validation**: Strict hostname and IP address validation
2. **Character Restrictions**: Prevent dangerous characters and patterns
3. **Network Validation**: Check for appropriate network segmentation
4. **User Education**: Provide security guidance for IoT device placement

## Attack Scenarios Prevented

**DNS Rebinding Attack**:
1. Attacker controls DNS server for malicious domain
2. User enters malicious domain in WLED config
3. DNS resolves to attacker-controlled server
4. **Mitigation**: Private network validation and hostname format checks

**Protocol Injection Attack**:
1. User enters `http://evil.com/wled` in hostname field
2. Could potentially bypass security controls
3. **Mitigation**: Protocol detection and rejection

**Hostname Injection Attack**:
1. User enters hostname with special characters
2. Could bypass validation or cause unexpected behavior
3. **Mitigation**: Character restrictions and format validation
