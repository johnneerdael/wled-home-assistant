# TODO: P2 - Improve Entity Naming to Use Device Name Instead of IP Address

## Problem Statement

The WLED integration currently uses IP addresses in entity names when device names are unavailable, creating a poor user experience with technical identifiers instead of user-friendly names. This makes it difficult for users to identify and manage their WLED devices in Home Assistant.

**Current Issue:** Entities appear as "WLED (192.168.1.100)" instead of using the actual device name from WLED configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Current Naming Implementation:**
```python
# light.py line 57
name=info.get(KEY_NAME, f"WLED ({self._entry.data['host']})")
```

**Naming Problems Identified:**

1. **Fallback to IP Address:** When `info.get(KEY_NAME)` returns None or empty, defaults to IP address
2. **Technical Identifiers:** IP addresses are not user-friendly for entity identification
3. **Inconsistent Naming:** Mix of device names and IP addresses across multiple devices
4. **Poor UX:** Users expect device names, not network addresses in Home Assistant UI

**WLED Device Name Availability:**
- WLED devices can be configured with custom names via web interface
- Device name available in `/json/info` response under `name` field
- Most users configure meaningful names (e.g., "Living Room Lights", "Bedroom Strip")
- IP address fallback only necessary when device truly has no name configured

**Home Assistant Entity Naming Best Practices:**
- Use device-specific names whenever available
- Provide meaningful, user-friendly identifiers
- Avoid technical network information in entity names
- Use `_attr_has_entity_name = True` for proper device-based naming

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Enhanced Device Name Resolution (Recommended)
- **Fix:** Improve device name detection with better fallback strategies
- **Implementation:** Enhanced name resolution with multiple fallback options
- **Benefit:** Proper device names while maintaining fallback reliability
- **Effort:** Small (30 minutes)
- **Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Configurable Entity Naming
- **Fix:** Allow users to configure custom names in integration options
- **Implementation:** Add configuration options for entity naming preferences
- **Benefit:** User control over entity naming
- **Effort:** Medium (1 hour)
- **Risk:** Low

### Option 3: Auto-Generated Names
- **Fix:** Generate descriptive names based on device characteristics
- **Implementation:** Use device info to create meaningful names (e.g., "WLED LED Controller")
- **Benefit:** Consistent naming without IP addresses
- **Effort:** Small (30 minutes)
- **Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

**Primary Fix:** Implement enhanced device name resolution with improved fallback strategies that prioritize user-friendly names over technical identifiers.

## Technical Details

**Affected Files:**
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/light.py` - Device info property (line 57)
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/select.py` - Future select entities (when implemented)
- `custom_components/wled_jsonapi/const.py` - Naming constants and patterns

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# light.py line 57
name=info.get(KEY_NAME, f"WLED ({self._entry.data['host']})")
```

**Enhanced Naming Implementation:**
```python
def _get_device_name(self, info: Dict) -> str:
    """Get device name with improved fallback strategy."""

    # Try device name from WLED info first
    device_name = info.get(KEY_NAME)
    if device_name and device_name.strip():
        return device_name.strip()

    # Try MAC address based name
    mac = info.get("mac")
    if mac:
        # Format MAC as readable name (e.g., "WLED-A1B2C3")
        mac_suffix = mac.replace(":", "").upper()[-6:]
        return f"WLED-{mac_suffix}"

    # Try architecture-based name
    arch = info.get("arch", "WLED Device")
    if arch and arch != "Unknown":
        return f"WLED {arch}"

    # Final fallback - avoid IP address
    return "WLED Device"

# Usage in device_info
@property
def device_info(self) -> DeviceInfo:
    """Return device info for this light."""
    info = self.coordinator.data.get("info", {})
    device_name = self._get_device_name(info)

    return DeviceInfo(
        identifiers={(DOMAIN, self._entry.unique_id)},
        name=device_name,
        manufacturer="WLED",
        model=info.get("arch", "Unknown"),
        sw_version=info.get("ver", "Unknown"),
        configuration_url=f"http://{self._entry.data['host']}",
    )
```

**Naming Priority Strategy:**
1. **Device Name** (from WLED config via `/json/info.name`)
2. **MAC-based Name** (e.g., "WLED-A1B2C3" from MAC address suffix)
3. **Architecture Name** (e.g., "WLED ESP32" from `info.arch`)
4. **Generic Name** ("WLED Device" as last resort)

**Additional Improvements:**
- Add `_attr_has_entity_name = True` for proper entity naming
- Ensure entity naming follows Home Assistant conventions
- Add translation key support for consistent naming patterns

## Implementation Strategy

**Enhanced Name Resolution:**
- Implement `_get_device_name()` helper method for consistent naming
- Use multiple fallback strategies to avoid IP addresses
- Prioritize user-configured device names from WLED settings
- Generate meaningful names from device characteristics when needed

**Entity Naming Improvements:**
- Ensure `_attr_has_entity_name = True` is set for all entities
- Use device info for consistent naming across all entity types
- Follow Home Assistant naming conventions and best practices

**Device Registry Integration:**
- Proper device registry entries with meaningful names
- Consistent naming across all entities for the same device
- Support for device configuration and management

**User Experience Focus:**
- User-friendly names that match user expectations
- Consistent naming patterns across multiple WLED devices
- Technical information available in device details, not entity names

## Validation Requirements

**Device Name Detection:**
- Test with WLED devices that have custom names configured
- Verify fallback behavior with unnamed devices
- Test MAC address parsing and formatting
- Validate architecture-based naming

**Home Assistant Integration:**
- Confirm proper device registry integration

- Verify device identification and management
- Test with multiple WLED devices for naming consistency

**User Experience Testing:**

## Notes

Source: Home Assistant entity naming documentation via Context7 MCP + WLED JSON API device info analysis
Priority: Important - significantly improves user experience and device identification
User Impact: Medium - better entity identification and management in Home Assistant UI
Discovery Method: Entity naming analysis comparing current implementation vs HA best practices
Recommendation: Implement to improve user experience and follow Home Assistant conventions

**WLED Device Name Configuration:**
- Most WLED users configure meaningful device names via web interface
